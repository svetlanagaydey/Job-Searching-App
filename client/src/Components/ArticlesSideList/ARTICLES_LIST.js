		title: "Smart Answers to Interview Questions",
		image: "",
		description: "Many interview questions are open-ended and require personalized and detailed answers that provide the employer with a good idea of your professional abilities and skills. There are ways to provide two- and three-part answers to make them sound professional and intelligent. In this article, we discuss what smart answers are, common interview questions with sample smart answers, as well as helpful tips.",

			{
				subtitle: "What are smart answers to interview questions?",
				text: "Smart answers to interview questions usually follow the STAR method. This method is a structured way to respond to common behavioral interview questions by specifically discussing the situation, task, action and result for each answer you provide. The answers should be detailed and specific but should exclude unnecessary information and rambling. \nWhen you give smart answers to interview questions, it is also important to avoid providing examples that display your negative qualities. However, you may provide answers about negative results and how you handled them to show the interviewer your strengths when faced with adversity."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "Why should we hire you?",
				text: "The best way to answer this question in a smart way is to focus on the interviewer and what you can bring to their company. You can do this by sharing how you meet the criteria they set and tell them about two or three qualities that you possess that they may not know they need. It is also important to think about any lessons you may have learned in the past that apply to what the company is currently experiencing.",
				example: "Example: I have been a bank manager for over four years and I have over 300 hours in leadership training with a focus on emotional intelligence in the workplace. I know that motivating and encouraging employees using emotional intelligence helps them to exceed company goals and increases their overall satisfaction at work. As a leader, I believe I can help the team members at your bank reach their potential and reduce employee turnover by establishing an open and honest workplace. I can do this by taking the time to communicate objectives, train effectively and anticipate potential issues that prevent productivity."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "What is your greatest strength?",
				text: "Most often, interview candidates think the answer to this question is their greatest overall strength. However, your answer should focus on your greatest strength that benefits the employer the most. Think about what the employer is looking for and what would make them believe that they should hire you now as opposed to later. This should be a three-part answer where you list the strength, provide proof of the strength and then describe how the strength is relevant to the job you are interviewing for.",
				example: "Example: Mediation is one of my major strengths. I have been working in human resources for six years, and I've learned the best ways to mediate manager-to-employee relationships using effective sociological and psychological techniques that make people feel heard, understood and acknowledged. My former employer had many issues with employees quitting due to micromanaging. I was able to facilitate and mediate conversations with several managers and employees to work out the best ways for them to work together. This resulted in a 30% increase in employee retention."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "Tell me about a previous accomplishment you are most proud of.",
				text: "When you are asked to tell the employer about your achievements, it allows you to brag about some of the greatest accomplishments in your career. The smartest strategy you can use to answer this question is to provide a recent accomplishment that communicates your ability to do well in the position they are hiring for.",
				example: "Example: I have accomplished many things in my career, however, the most recent one that applies to this job is winning top sales consultant in the state at my previous company. Our branch was struggling to meet sales goals the previous year and this was a challenge because many new branches were opening in our area. I suggested a new marketing technique that would allow us to gain more qualified leads. The technique was implemented and I began managing my time more effectively to handle the influx of leads and closed 45% of the leads I pitched to."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "Why are you leaving your current job?",
				text: "This question should be answered in a neutral or positive tone. You never want to bash your former manager or company. The best way to answer this question in a smart way is to bring out a reason that the hiring manager is not concerned about. For instance, growth opportunities, career change or moving are less likely to raise flags for an employer.",
				example: "Example: My current job has been a great learning experience and I have developed many skills during my three years with XYZ company. I am seeking a new opportunity with your company because it appears to fit well with the direction I would like to take my career. I have heard great things about this organization and I'm excited to develop my expertise further with this opportunity."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "Tell me about yourself.",
				text: "This question is one that may cause concern. However, there is an easy way to answer it by thinking of it as an invitation to share the things about yourself that are important to the hiring managers' decision to select you. This should be a two-part answer that describes your qualifications and why you are interested in the position with this particular company.",
				example: "Example: I am currently a social media marketing director for TLR Marketing Firm. Over the last five years, I have completed my graduate education while working full time. I have progressed through positions such as marketing assistant, social media marketing specialist and social media marketing director."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "What motivates you?",
				text: "The interviewer typically asks this question to get a sense of the drive you have to produce results. They need to know if you are self-motivated or if you require a great deal of outside motivation. The best way to answer this question is in a thoughtful and honest way.",
				example: "Example: I am highly motivated by deadlines. I find that when I have a set date for something to be completed I am more productive and I finish the work before the due date. For example, I worked on a large project last year and I set several deadlines for small tasks leading up to the completion of the project. This helps keep me motivated and results in me completing the project on time."

		title: "How to Deal With the Stress of Losing Your Job",
		image: "",
		description: "Losing a job is one of the top five most stressful events in a person's life, and as of April, 20.5 million people are experiencing such loss due to COVID-19. In addition, people are dealing with avoiding sickness, losing or caring for loved ones, teaching kids home from school and other potential stressors. In this article, we sat down with psychologist Nancy Lin to understand how job-related stress can affect you, including tips on how to deal with the stress of losing your job and simple actions you can take today.",
		content: [
			{
				subtitle: "What is stress?",
				text: "Psychologists often define stress as “...an imbalance in which your perceptions of loss, threat or challenge (such as losing your job) outweigh your perceived ability to cope with the situation.\nWhen experiencing stress, your body undergoes a series of responses to address the threat by releasing stress hormones and engaging a fight or flight response. While this natural response can be life-saving in dangerous situations, Dr. Sin says, “This response is less helpful for preparing us to handle the types of stressful situations we face in the modern world. The repeated activation of these physiological stress systems can accumulate over time to cause wear-and-tear on our bodies. As a result, people who are under long-term stress (such as unemployment) are at greater risk for the development of chronic health conditions [...] compared to those who are not under long-term stress."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "Ways to deal with stress after a job loss",
				text: "While feeling stress or anxiety due to job loss is your body's way of taking care of you, its effects on your ability to job search may be counterproductive. You may be feeling stress due to the lack of control involved in both job loss and finding a new job. As such, it can be helpful to take back some control with small, simple actions.	Here are several steps you can take to combat the effects of long-term stress:"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "1. Allow yourself time to grieve",
				text: "Allow yourself time to grieve with a goal to move towards acceptance quickly. The five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance—are a part of the framework that helps us learn to live with loss. The stress of losing a job can be attributed to things like losing financial security or the loss of your connection to a great team. Lingering in the first stages for too long can limit your ability to create an action plan and may impact your perception of your future employability. If you were laid off due to the impact of COVID-19 through no fault of your own, remember that you have unique skills, knowledge, and qualities to offer your next employer."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "2. Assess your financial situation",
				text: "One of the major stressors that stem from the loss of a job is the impact on financial stability. One national survey about financial management practices found that only 46% of respondents used a budget. Understanding where your money is going as well as when and how much you’re spending can help relieve some of the stress surrounding your finances. Once you know how much it costs to cover your expenses, you can reassess your accounts and financial security, adjusting as needed."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "3. Set small career-related goals",
				text: "The career planning process begins with self-reflection and identifying what is most valuable to you in a job. An initial exercise for identifying what you require in a job vs. what you would prefer is completing a needs vs. wants assessment. Doing so can help you to define your minimum job requirements versus perks, benefits or other qualities that are nice to have. Once identified, you can compare potential job opportunities to your sheet to find a job that best fits your individual needs and wants. The components of a needs vs. wants assessment include your salary requirements, job responsibilities, healthcare, work/life balance, professional development and company culture. Most of us must balance looking for jobs that meet our requirements with finding opportunities within the right time frame to support ourselves and our families. If you must take a job out of necessity, you can still include this experience to build out a strong resume in the future by limiting the description of the role to your responsibilities and accomplishments that align with your ideal job."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "4. Take time for personal reflection",
				text: "Time for personal reflection is a benefit that comes with a break in employment. Here are some simple tips to help you set time for yourself without losing productivity. A common occurrence after a job loss is developing a habit of constantly applying to jobs to maintain a feeling of productivity. While a high level of activity can give you the sense that you’re being active, it can quickly lead to job search burnout. Take regular time off from the job search to combat this form of stress. Use the time to reset and have a fresh start the next day. Connecting with your support system is critical during a time of uncertainty. When experiencing grief, it’s possible to develop feelings of isolation that can heighten your level of stress. Have regular conversations with your support system to check-in, ask for help if needed and simply enjoy your time together. "

			{
				subtitle: "5. Maintain or adopt a healthy routine",
				text: "Dr. Sin also reported that stress affects our health behaviors by causing us to “be less physically active, eat a less nutritious diet and be less likely to maintain good sleep habits.” Understanding those tendencies and developing small but meaningful practices to stay healthy can help counteract them. According to Dr. Sin, “One of the best ways to counteract stress (and to reduce the negative impacts of stress on your health) is to practice good health behaviors. In fact, there is evidence suggesting that when you engage in physical activity, you are less likely to show a heightened emotional response to stressful events on the same day.”  Sleep disruption commonly occurs after a job loss because of interference with your normal daily schedule. Seven to nine hours of sleep is recommended for adults and has been proven to be a powerful stress reducer. Using a controlled breathing technique before bed is a good way to set yourself up for a restful night of sleep. Other tips include limiting distractions such as TV, cell phones and tablets, exercising during the day and establishing a bedtime routine. If you find that you still struggle to get quality sleep, it might be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional."

		title: "Best Ways To Find a Job: Six Methods That Really Work",
		image: "",
		description: "Whether you are looking for your first job after graduating from college or high school or you're looking to change companies or progress in your career, it is vital to know how to look for a job. Although finding a new job might seem challenging, there are many different methods to find one effectively and efficiently. In this article, we give you six effective ways to find a job that's right for you.\n There are many different ways to find a job, from searching in industry publications and browsing the internet to subscribing to job search emails. Here are six different approaches you can take to boost your job search:",
		content: [
			{
				subtitle: "1. Ask your network for referrals.",
				text: "If you are looking for a job, you should tell all your contacts to help them help you find mutual career contacts. Networking is an effective way of finding a new job, and employers prefer receiving a referral from a trusted member of their staff. Many jobs are filled internally from referrals before they are even advertised, so it's important to talk to the right people to get as many referrals from within your network as you can.\nStart by making a list of everyone that you know and determine which individuals might know about available positions in your industry. Then, you reach out to those people, perhaps offering to get coffee or lunch to discuss your interests and goals further.\nAim to build closer relationships with the people in your network so they think of you first when they hear of job openings. Some jobs can be filled rapidly, so you want to make sure that you strategically network with influential people whenever possible."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "2. Contact companies directly.",
				text: "Job searches are much more straightforward now that most companies have websites that you can target directly. You will be able to apply directly for available positions listed through their website. If a company you are interested in doesn't have any relevant jobs posted on their website, reach out to them via email or phone to see if they are looking to employ someone with your qualifications and experience. If a company is not actively recruiting for your role, you may not hear back from them, but they may keep you on file in case a position becomes available in the future. The recruitment process costs a considerable amount of money, so if an employer hears from a suitable candidate directly before posting a job, they might favor employing you rather than spending time and money searching for other candidates. Also, if a company is experiencing rapid growth, they may be particularly open to hearing from qualified people, even if they have not advertised a position. This applies to start-up companies that have not yet fully considered their staffing needs."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "3. Use job search platforms.",
				text: "If you want to apply for a large number of jobs quickly and efficiently, use job search platforms to power your search. Most top job search engines will allow you to search jobs by location, wage and keywords. Also, if possible, upload a resume and cover letter that you can adapt to each application. Job search platforms are great because they allow you to filter out job search results that do not apply to you, while also allowing you to set up custom job search alerts to alert you when a job is posted that meets your criteria."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "4. Go to job fairs.",
				text: "A job or career fair is a special event that aims to get companies and potential employees together to network and share information. These events are frequented by big companies that are looking to recruit large numbers of employees as well as fresh graduates for training programs. You will find organizations of all sizes, recruiters and possibly even colleges and universities at these events. Job fairs are a great opportunity to network and distribute your resume to potential employers. It's a good idea to research an upcoming fair ahead of time to find out which companies will be attending so that when you talk to their recruiters, you will make a good and knowledgeable impression. Remember to take your business cards and plenty of resumes with you. Depending on the type of job you are applying for, you may also need to take samples of your work, a portfolio and/or references from past employers. Since you will be meeting with potential new employers for the first time, aim to make a great first impression and wear appropriate, professional clothing. It is also a good idea to make a list of questions that you want to ask the recruiters. You will make a memorable impression if you appear genuinely interested in a company. Also, ensure that you are friendly and personable when talking to potential employers and that you sound confident and maintain eye contact when speaking."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "5. Leverage social media.",
				text: "There are many different social media platforms you can use to search for jobs and interact with companies you'd like to work for. You can search for company pages on sites like Facebook and Instagram and follow them, no matter where they are in the world. By keeping up to date with a company's social media pages, you can gain valuable insights into their tone, interests and working style. You can also comment on their posts and start to build a relationship with them. You may even hear about job openings they have through these channels. If you are using social media for professional purposes, it's important to make your own profiles suitable. They should convey a good image of you, even though you are using the platforms for personal rather than professional purposes. Use your real name and only publish appropriate pictures and posts."
			},
			{
				subtitle: "6. Inquire at staffing agencies.",
				text: "Signing up with a staffing or recruitment agency may be worth considering if you want to find jobs more effectively. Most towns have several staffing agencies that you can register with. Some are industry-specific and others deal with many different industries. You will likely need to provide a resume as well as copies of your certifications and qualifications, and you may need to sit for tests such as typing speed or knowledge of specific industries. Some agencies may only deal with short-term and temporary contracts at first. This may not be exactly what you were hoping for but if you gain temporary employment with a company and impress them with your work, it could lead to a permanent job. It also gives you the chance to meet people who work in your industry, which can lead to other networking or referral opportunities. A short-term contract can also provide you with further experience to find out if you are actually suited to the role. This is useful if you are not entirely certain what sort of job you want to do."

		title: "Top 10 Programming/Coding Interview Questions",
		image: "",
		description: "A software developer interview gauges your ability to understand the programming languages required for the job and tests your general coding knowledge. In this article, we review 10 basic coding interview questions with sample answers, plus provide tips for preparing for your interview. The following are 10 coding interview questions with example answers that should help you describe your work experience and prepare for your programming interview:",
		content: [
			{
				subtitle: "1. What programming languages do you know?",
				text: "Use your response to this question to show that you prepared for the interview and researched what language the company uses. Consider including more than one example of your experiences with different languages in your response, and show your portfolio that includes the languages you’ve used. You can also explain languages currently popular in the industry if you feel it’ll set you apart from other candidates.",
				exapmle: "Example: “I am very familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and in my most recent programming position at Global Company, we used Python to write software applications. I learned Python throughout the projects I completed there, and feel comfortable learning other languages for specific projects.“"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "2. Which programming language do you prefer?",
				text: "In your response, you may discuss a language you’d prefer for responding to technical questions. Pick one you can explain to someone who may not know it as well as you. If you’re familiar with multiple languages, choose a more dynamic language than an older one like HTML.",
				exapmle: "Example: “Although different languages work best with certain projects, I like Python for solving algorithmic problems. I find that it’s simple to use and offers attractive features. After my experience with it at Global Company, I wanted to develop my Python understanding further, so I designed and developed a software application for a mobile game to practice speaking elements while learning a new language. I feel that I have a strong understanding of Python based on my professional and personal experience.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "3. What’s your process for a crashing program?",
				text: "For an effective response to this question, you’ll need to use both hard skills and soft skills. Carefully explain your process to your interviewer in a conversational and logical way to show you thoroughly understand the process. Describe how you would search for the bug and the steps toward a solution.",
				exapmle: "Example: “I worked at a startup called Innotech after grad school. I enjoyed the projects I worked on there, but we frequently had problems with crashing programs. After I run a debugger, I look for patterns. For example, maybe the program crashes while running certain commands or in specific conditions. If the program only crashes every fifth time the page loads, I would look into that further. Once I have identified patterns, I would then consider ideas for problem areas that might include elements of those patterns and use a code to search those possible elements. I am usually successful with this method.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "4. How do you keep your technical industry knowledge current?",
				text: "The programming field is constantly evolving, and you can highlight that you enjoy learning new elements and languages to grow.",
				exapmle: "Example: “I enjoy keeping my programming knowledge current and the challenge of learning new languages. I regularly listen to programming podcasts and participate in online communities with other programmers. I also find that online courses are helpful to learn new skills. While I was learning Python, I used podcasts and online courses to study the language while working on a project. I feel these methods work well for me.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "5. How would you handle working on a team with people from other departments?",
				text: "During a programming interview, you’ll take technical tests or complete technical interviews. You can use these opportunities to showcase your soft skills as well, such as providing examples of your interpersonal and communication skills.",
				exapmle: "Example “I work well on teams, including ones with non-tech members. I find that these groups can produce products and solutions that a team of like-minded people may not consider. I also enjoy meeting new people and considering other angles to the projects we work on together. I have worked on teams with only programmers and mixed teams in the past, and feel the mixed groups were often more innovative. I would welcome an opportunity to work on this type of team.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "6. What process happens after you type in a website’s URL?",
				text: "This question allows you to show how thoroughly you understand the process.",
				exapmle: "Example: “The first step is to type your URL into the browser. The browser will then check the DNS record and cache to find the corresponding IP address. Then, the browser may have to check the operating system cache, the router cache and the ISP cache. The ISP’s DNS server then initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts the site and the browser initiates a TCP connection with the server. Last, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, the server sends a response and the browser displays the HTML content.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "7. How would you find the maximum chain length of a pair?",
				text: "You may find that preparing for the hard skills portion of your programming interview is fairly straightforward. You can find practice tests in books and online that offer you a chance to simulate the technical elements of your programming interview. You can focus your studies on understanding and being able to explain the processes you may use.",
				exapmle: "Example: “I would use a sorting mechanism to sort within the given parameters for the pair. Then, I would use a LIS process to compare the elements. There are other methods, but I would try this one first. Would you like me to write the code out?”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "8. Can you describe a coding project you’ve worked on?",
				text: "With this response, you can demonstrate a project you worked on that gained commercial attention or one your company implemented. Focus on results and show your success to produce programs people can use.",
				exapmle: "Example: “The language learning app I created, SpeakR, became fairly successful. Within three months on the market, more than 20,000 users downloaded the app. Because I initially planned the project for extra practice with Python, it was exciting to see the app gain attention.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "9. How do you begin a new project?",
				text: "When you respond to this question, emphasize your planning process and show that you can stay organized aside from your technical abilities. Use this opportunity to practice the STAR method again.",
				exapmle: "Example: “When I begin a project, I like to choose the technical aspects first like the language and library I’ll use. Then I plan the features and use visuals to fully develop these plans. After that, I will consider how to best implement them. Last, I like to plan a timeline and schedule for completing the project. I have used this system at work to stay ahead of schedule. One project I planned from start to finish was the addition of a user wiki. I first decided to implement the Scrum method and chose Python to code the wiki. Python is a fast language that would be highly accessible for my team. I considered the team members needed to implement and did requirements gathering. Finally, I planned and completed a sprint. Using this practical method of thinking through projects allowed my team to complete the wiki quickly and efficiently.”"
			},
			{
				subtitle: "10. How do you handle deadlines?",
				text: "As a programmer, you’ll work toward project deadlines regularly. You can use your response to this question to emphasize that you work well with deadlines and discuss planning methods you use to manage your time and projects.",
				exapmle: "Example: “I enjoy project deadlines and find that I like to plan my own smaller goals for tasks I need to complete to reach my work deadlines. I use my desktop calendar to assign regular goals throughout my work weeks. I developed this method to stay organized. In past roles, I created department calendars that enabled my department to stay on schedule.”"
