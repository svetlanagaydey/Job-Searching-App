This method is a structured way to respond to common behavioral interview questions by specifically discussing the situation, task, action and result for each answer you provide. The answers should be detailed and specific but should exclude unnecessary information and rambling. \nWhen you give smart answers to interview questions, it is also important to avoid providing examples that display your negative qualities. However, you may provide answers about negative results and how you handled them to show the interviewer your strengths when faced with adversity."

				subtitle: "What is stress?",
				text: "Psychologists often define stress as “...an imbalance in which your perceptions of loss, threat or challenge (such as losing your job) outweigh your perceived ability to cope with the situation.\nWhen experiencing stress, your body undergoes a series of responses to address the threat by releasing stress hormones and engaging a fight or flight response. While this natural response can be life-saving in dangerous situations, Dr. Sin says, “This response is less helpful for preparing us to handle the types of stressful situations we face in the modern world. The repeated activation of these physiological stress systems can accumulate over time to cause wear-and-tear on our bodies. As a result, people who are under long-term stress (such as unemployment) are at greater risk for the development of chronic health conditions [...] compared to those who are not under long-term stress."

				text: "If you are looking for a job, you should tell all your contacts to help them help you find mutual career contacts. Networking is an effective way of finding a new job, and employers prefer receiving a referral from a trusted member of their staff. Many jobs are filled internally from referrals before they are even advertised, so it's important to talk to the right people to get as many referrals from within your network as you can.\nStart by making a list of everyone that you know and determine which individuals might know about available positions in your industry. Then, you reach out to those people, perhaps offering to get coffee or lunch to discuss your interests and goals further.\nAim to build closer relationships with the people in your network so they think of you first when they hear of job openings. Some jobs can be filled rapidly, so you want to make sure that you strategically network with influential people whenever possible."
